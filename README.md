## My Task

My task this week was to build a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions. This app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that I wrote. Additionally, it has a clean, polished, and responsive user interface.

## User Story

```
AS A coding boot camp student,
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers.
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I am taking a code quiz:
1. WHEN I click the start button,
    THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question.
2. WHEN I answer a question,
    THEN I am presented with another question.
3. WHEN I answer a question incorrectly,
    THEN time is subtracted from the clock.
4. WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0, 
    THEN the game is over.
5. WHEN the game is over,
    THEN I can save my initials and my score.
```

## Mock-Up
